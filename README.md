# Arduino sketches

These are some personal sketches made for Arduino. Used mostly for personal projects and messing around, but anyone is free to use them.

My primary project is a sound booster which is placed near the furnace intake and will raise the volume when the furnace starts and lower the volume once it's off.

This project uses a Sparkfun Sound Detector, a IR LED (to send the commands to the TV), and a potentiometer to set a volume needed to trigger the device.
